        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application that allows guests at a party to democratically curate a playlist for the party they are attending. The purpose of PartyAll is to solve the issues and inefficiencies behind manually creating a playlist that a group of people agree on and to avoid having one person monopolizing the music.
        </p>

        <h3 id="purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this document is to illustrate the software requirements of the PartyAll web application. This document is targeted towards the developers of the application and to any users or individuals looking to gain an in depth understanding of the application.
        </p>

        <h3 id="scope">1.2 Scope</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a mobile friendly web application that allows multiple people to collectively curate a playlist. Users of PartyAll will classify themselves as one of two types, either a Host or Guest. A Host can create a party or in other words a new playlist. A Guest, given an access key, will be allowed to access the party and request songs to be queued up. Users, (both of type Host and Guest) will be allowed to upvote songs moving them higher up the queue as they gain more votes than other songs. PartyAll will automatically traverse the queue, playing songs until the end of the queue is reached, or the party is ended by the creating Host.
            Parties that a Host creates can be manually stopped by the Host or will be automatically stopped after 3 hours of inactivity (no songs playing). There will be no persistent user accounts, minimizing the steps required to go from opening the web page to starting a party. The requirements for creating a party are a unique party name and password. Upon successful creation the Host will be presented with a system generated 3-6 character guest key which will be distributed to the party's guests.
            Hosts sign in to their created party using the party name and admin password as credentials. Once the Host signs in, he/she will hit the play button to start playing the song at the top of the queue. Once a guest has arrived, they can then use the party name and guest key to view the Hosts party queue, request, and upvote songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            PartyAll aims to make the process of deciding on what music to play at a party as efficient and crowd-pleasing as possible.
        </p>

        <h3 id="definitions">1.3 Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Party:</h4> A Party is a playlist of songs that is curated by the Host and Guests. A party can be paused or stopped, and songs in a party can be upvoted to manipulate the order of the play queue. Songs in a party can also be skipped by the Host of that party.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Host:</h4> The Host is a type of user that can create a party, sign in to an existing party, pause music, skip songs and stop/delete a party. This user provides Guests with a guest key and party name allowing them to view the party queue and vote for songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Guest:</h4> The Guest is a party-goer who wants to decide on the upcoming songs. This user will access a party via the guest key provided to them by a Host.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Upvote:</h4> A unit used to measure the ranking weight of a song in the Party queue.

        <p>
            The rest of this document goes into details on the various flows found in the PartyAll app. This includes how various types of users are expected to interact with the app, and how the app behaves.

        <h3 id="product_perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application with two major components. There is the PartyAll front end, and the PartyAll Service (back end).
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Front End:</h4>
            The PartyAll front end is the user interface component of the app. This is the component that will be accessible to users. It will consist of a mobile friendly responsive website that scales according to the device it is being displayed on. It will support a variety of screen sizes and resolutions, ranging from smartphones to TVs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Back End:</h4>
            The PartyAll service is the component of the app responsible for storing party data such as party name, encrypted party passwords, song queues, and upvote count for each song. Additionally, this service generates party guest keys to send back to Hosts that create parties. The service will also store the PartyAll front end's public key for verifying requests sent to the service are actually from the PartyAll app. The service is also responsible for rearranging the song queue when songs are upvoted, breaking ties in the queue by giving priority to songs added earlier. The service is also responsible for cleaning up party sessions after 3 hours of inactivity (no songs playing).              
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="product_functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application. For users to access it they will visit the app's url on any device that has a web browser. Upon visiting the website the user will be presented with an intro screen briefly explaining the app and an option for the user to specify what type of user they are. The user will be allowed to pick one of two types, either a Host or a Guest.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Create Party Flow - Host:</h4>
            If the user selects to be a Host they will be navigated to the Host page. Here the user will get to decide whether they wish to create a party or sign in to an already created party. If the Host chooses to create a party, he or she will be presented with a form. The form will contain 2 fields, party name and password. The party name will be the unique public identifier for the party, the password is the password a Host requires to access the party if they were to navigate away or log out. After successfully creating a party the Host will be presented with a success screen and on that screen will be a 3-6 character system generated guest access key. The guest access key is the public password the Host will provide to his/her Guests allowing them to view the party playlist queue, upvote songs and requests new songs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From here on in the Host can play songs, request songs, search for songs to queue up, upvote songs, skip songs, pause music, and end the party.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Access Existing Party Flow - Host:</h4>
            If the user is a Host and instead of creating a new party he/she wishes to access an already created party, a login form will be presented, requesting a party name and password. Upon successful login the Host will be presented with the same party screen along with the same functionality as described above.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <h4>Access Party Flow - Guest:</h4>
            If the users are of type Guest, they will be presented with a login screen. The login screen will consist of a single box asking for the user to enter a unique guest access password given to them by a host. After successful login the Guest will be presented with the guest perspective of the party page.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The guest perspective of the party page shows the song queue of the party, allowing Guests to upvote songs, request songs, and log out.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Request Song Flow - Host &amp Guest:</h4>
            When a user hits the search icon from either the guest party page or the host party page, the user will be presented with an input box. The user will then enter the name of the song they wish to queue up and perform a search. The user will then tap on the song they wish to request and verify that they do wish to queue up the requested song by confirming the dialog that appears.             
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Upvoting Songs - Host &amp Guest:</h4>
            Users, from either the Host or Guest party page can upvote songs in the queue by simply tapping on them. Tapping on a song that a user had already upvoted will remove the user's upvote from that song.
        </p>

        <h3 id="user_characteristics">2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is intended to be a very simple and intuitive web app. As there are two different user experiences, there are also two categories of users.
        </p> 

        <p>
            <h4>Host Characteristics:</h4>

            The user hosting the party on PartyAll is not required to have any in-depth technical expertise or training. Experience using a digital media player such as iTunes (play, pause, skip, etc...) will aid in the amount of time it takes the Host to become familiar with the application. Hosts also have the ability to vote for songs like Guests and therefore must also have the same characteristics as a guest (detailed below).
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Guest Characteristics:</h4>

            The ParyAll web app is meant to be used by guests at parties where he or she is engaging in social interaction and would only want to take a few seconds to use PartyAll to vote for the next song to play before returning to the party. The Guest's technical expertise is required to extend only as far as being able to turn on his or her phone and access the web app. The app's user interface will only have a few very clear options and therefore the user does not need to have any further training prior to use. In fact, as the app will be used at parties it is not guaranteed that the user will be completely void of the effects of alcohol and therefore PartyAll needs to be as simple as possible.
        </p>

        <h3 id="constraints">2.4 Constraints</h3>
        <p>
            The only constraints PartyAll will have are the rate limitations in place by the YouTube API the app will use. At the time of this writing, YouTube's API limitations are 30,000 units/second/user and 50,000,000 per day. More information on YouTube's API quota can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="assumptions">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
            The assumptions made when creating this document were that the app will not an admin interface and that any admin tools required will be automated into cron jobs (automated scheduled tasks the service runs) or be provided to us by the tools of the datastore we choose to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, this document was created based on the assumption that this is only the first iteration of the application, omitting some features that will come in future versions of the app. This allows developers to quickly release a minimal viable product that is both doable in a specified time period and is functional enough for release.
        </p>

        <h2 id="requirements_specifications">3. Requirements Specification</h2>
        <h3 id="external_interface_requirements">3.1 External Interface Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The only external interface PartyAll relies on is the YouTube Music API it uses to power searching and playing music.
